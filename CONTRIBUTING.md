## Joining the community

BIDS - the [Brain Imaging Data Structure](http://bids.neuroimaging.io/) - is a growing community of neuroimaging enthusiasts, and we want to make our resources accessible to and engaging for as many researchers as possible.

We therefore require that all contributions **adhere to our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)**.

How do you know that you're a member of the BIDS community? You're here! You know that BIDS exists! You're officially a member of the community. It's THAT easy! Welcome!

### Help and support using BIDS

Our preferred place to answer questions about BIDS is via
[Neurostars](https://neurostars.org/tags/bids).

Answering via this forum means **others who have similar questions can benefit
from you asking them!** Even if your question is not well-defined, just post
what you have so far and we will be able to point you in the right direction.

Some example questions that have already been answered include:
[BIDS file naming specifications](https://neurostars.org/t/bids-beginner-convert-data-to-bids-format/1364) and [BIDS beginner - convert data to BIDS format](https://neurostars.org/t/bids-beginner-convert-data-to-bids-format/1364).

You can also check out the [BIDS Starter Kit](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-starter-kit)
for help and advice on working with BIDS files and tools.

### Developing the specification

## Contributing through GitHub

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a really useful tool for version control. [GitHub](https://github.com/) sits on top of git and supports collaborative and distributed working.

We know that it can be daunting to start using git and GitHub if you haven't worked with them in the past, but the BIDS Specification maintainers are here to help you figure out any of the jargon or confusing instructions you encounter!

In order to contribute via GitHub you'll need to set up a free account and sign in. Here are some [instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account/) to help you get going. Remember that you can ask us any questions you need to along the way.

### Writing in markdown

Whether you're contributing to the specification, commenting on issues, or
reviewing pull requests, most of the writing that you'll do for this project
will be in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown). You can
think of Markdown as a few little symbols around your text that will allow
GitHub to render the text with a little bit of formatting. For example you could
write words as bold (`**bold**`), or in italics (`*italics*`), or as a
[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)
(`[link](https://https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)`) to another webpage.

GitHub has a helpful page on
[getting started with writing and formatting on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github).

### Following the Markdown Style Guide

The specification documents in this repository follow the
[Markdown Style Guide](http://www.cirosantilli.com/markdown-style-guide/).

You can validate your changes against the guide using
[remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint) which works as a
[standalone command line tool](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/master/packages/remark-cli)
as well as
[a plugin for various text editors](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint#editor-integrations).

Remark preserves consistent markdown styling across the contributions. Before
submitting a contribution **please ensure that you do not have any linter
errors in your text editor**. You can also use
[prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) to automatically correct some
of the style issuse that might be found in the proposed changes.

We have deployed a continous integrator ([circle CI](https://circleci.com/)) to
further allow for integrating changes continously. The CI is testing that the
changes are inline with our standard styling.

### Building the specification using mkdocs

We are using mkdocs to render our specification. Please follow these instructions if you would like to build the specification locally.

#### 1. Install mkdocs

To begin please follow [this link](https://www.mkdocs.org/#installation) to install mkdocs locally.

#### 2. Download the BIDS specification [repository](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/tree/master) onto your computer

This can be done by clicking the green button on the right titled "Clone or download"

#### 3. Install our theme

Please go [here](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) and install our theme - material. The terminal command is `pip install mkdocs-material`

#### 4. In the terminal (command line) navigate to your local version of the specification

This location will have the same files you see on our [main specification page](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification). Note: A finder window may not show the hidden files (those that start with a period i.e. .remarkrc)

#### 5. Ready to build!

Using the terminal (command line) please enter `mkdocs serve`. This will allow you to see a local version of the specification. The local address will be `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. You may enter that into your browser and this will bring up the specification!

### Making a change with a pull request

We appreciate all contributions to the BIDS Specification. **THANK YOU** for helping us build this useful resource.

#### 1. Comment on an existing issue or open a new issue referencing your addition

This allows other members of the BIDS Specification team to confirm that you aren't overlapping with work that's currently underway and that everyone is on the same page with the goal of the work you're going to carry out.


#### 2. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) [this repository](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification) to your profile

This is now your own unique copy of the BIDS Specification. Changes here won't affect anyone else's work, so it's a safe space to explore edits to the specification!

Make sure to [keep your fork up to date](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/) with the master repository, otherwise you can end up with lots of dreaded [merge conflicts](https://help.github.com/articles/about-merge-conflicts/).

#### 3. Make the changes you've discussed

Try to keep the changes focused. If you submit a large amount of work in all in one go it will be much more work for whomever is reviewing your pull request. Please detail the changes you are attempting to make.

#### 4. Submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)

A member of the BIDS Specification team will review your changes to confirm that they can be merged into the main codebase.

A [review](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-request-reviews/) will probably consist of a few questions to help clarify the work you've done. Keep an eye on your github notifications and be prepared to join in that conversation.

You can update your [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/about-forks/) of the BIDS Specification and the pull request will automatically update with those commits. You don't need to submit a new pull request when you make a change in response to a review.

GitHub has a [nice introduction](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flow/) to the pull request workflow, but please [get in touch](#get-in-touch) if you have any questions.
